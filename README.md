# alx-airbnb-database
**Project Overview**

This project is part of the comprehensive ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. The goal is to design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

**Objectives**
- Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.
- Master the art of normalization to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
- Use SQL DDL to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance optimization.
- Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data, simulating real-world scenarios.
- Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

**Key Highlights**
- 1. **Defining Relationships with ER diagrams** - Creating an ER diagram, modeling relationships and dependencies between users, bookings, properties, and reviews in the Airbnb schema.
- 2. **Complex Queries with Joins** - Combining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights. Explores INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
- 3. **Power Subqueries** - Correlated and non-correlated subqueries. Nesting queries for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filering users based on activity threshold.
