# Advanced Querying Power
Focuses on implemnting advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques to work with a simulated Airbnb database.
**Key Highlights**
- 1. **Defining Relationships with ER diagrams** - Creating an ER diagram, modeling relationships and dependencies between users, bookings, properties, and reviews in the Airbnb schema.
- 2. **Complex Queries with Joins** - Combining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights. Explores INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
- 3. **Power Subqueries** - Correlated and non-correlated subqueries. Nesting queries for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filering users based on activity threshold.
- 4. **Aggregations and Window Functions** - Using SQL aggregation functions like COUNT and SUM and avanced window functions like ROW_NUMBER and RANK to rank and analyze data sets. 
- 5. **Indexing for Optmization** - Indentifying performance bottlenecks and writing SQL commands to create indexes for frequently queried columns. 
- 6. **Query Optimization Techniques** - Writing and analyzing complex queries for retrieving detailed information about booking s, properties, users, and payments. Refactoring queries to improve execution times by reducing redundancies and leveraging indexing.
- 7. **Partitioning Large Tables** - Addressing performance challenges with large datasets by implementing table partitioning. Focus on partitioning Booking table to improve queries on date ranges and compare performance before and leveraging index.
- 8. **Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement** - Monitoring query performance using SHOW PROFILE and EXPLAIN ANALYZE, idenfitying bottlenecks, and proposing schema changes.
